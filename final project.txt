The scene was not exactly new to me.  Moved by the spirit of adventure,
or by an access of ennui which overtakes me at times, I had several
times visited the gaudy establishment of Mercer, on the fashionable
side of Fifth Avenue in the Fifties.  In either case I had found
disappointment; where the stake is a matter of indifference there can
be no excitement; and besides, I had been always in luck.
